      <td>River water quality assessment is one of the most important tasks to enhance water resources management plans. A water quality index (WQI) considers several water quality variables simultaneously. Traditionally WQI calculations consume time and are often fraught with errors during derivations of sub-indices. In this study, 4 standalone (random forest (RF), M5P, random tree (RT), and reduced error pruning tree (REPT)) and 12 hybrid data-mining algorithms (combinations of standalones with bagging (BA), CV parameter selection (CVPS) and randomizable filtered classification (RFC)) were used to create Iran WQI (IRWQIsc) predictions. Six years (2012 to 2018) of monthly data from two water quality monitoring stations within the Talar catchment were compiled. Using Pearson correlation coefficients, 10 different input combinations were constructed. The data were divided into two groups (ratio 70:30) for model building (training dataset) and model validation (testing dataset) using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. The models were evaluated using several statistical and visual evaluation metrics. Result show that fecal coliform (FC) and total solids (TS) had the greatest and least effect on the prediction of IRWQIsc. The best input combinations varied among the algorithms; generally variables with very low correlations displayed weaker performance. Hybrid algorithms improved the prediction power of several of the standalone models, but not all. Hybrid BA-RT outperformed the other models (R2 = 0.941, RMSE = 2.71, MAE = 1.87, NSE = 0.941, PBIAS = 0.500). PBIAS indicated that all algorithms, with the exceptions of RT, BA-RT and CVPS-REPT, overestimated WQI values.</td>

      <td>Groundwater is an important source to supply drinking water demands in both arid and semi-arid regions. Nevertheless, locating high quality drinking water is a major challenge in such areas. Against this background, this study proceeds to utilize and compare five decision tree-based data mining algorithms including Ordinary Decision Tree (ODT), Random Forest (RF), Random Tree (RT), Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID), and Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) for rule induction in order to identify high quality groundwater zones for drinking purposes. The proposed methodology works by initially extracting key relevant variables affecting water quality (electrical conductivity, pH, hardness and chloride) out of a total of eight existing parameters, and using them as inputs for the rule induction process. The algorithms were evaluated with reference to both continuous and discrete datasets. The findings were speculative of the superiority, performance-wise, of rule induction using the continuous dataset as opposed to the discrete dataset. Based on validation results, in continuous dataset, RF and ODT showed higher and RT showed acceptable performance. The groundwater quality maps were generated by combining the effective parameters distribution maps using inducted rules from RF, ODT, and RT, in GIS environment. A quick glance at the generated maps reveals a drop in the quality of groundwater from south to north as well as from east to west in the study area. The RF showed the highest performance (accuracy of 97.10%) among its counterparts; and so the generated map based on rules inducted from RF is more reliable. The RF and ODT methods are more suitable in the case of continuous dataset and can be applied for rule induction to determine water quality with higher accuracy compared to other tested algorithms.</td>

      <td>Strymon is a transboundary river of Greece, Bulgaria and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) in southeastern Europe. Water quality parameters and the discharge have been monitored each month just 10 km downstream of the river's entry into Greece. The data of nine water quality variables (T, ECw, DO, SO 4 2-, Na + +K + , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , NO 3-, TP) and the discharge for the period 1980-1997 were selected for this analysis. In this paper a) the time series of monthly values of water quality parameters and the discharge were analysed using statistical methods, b) the existence of trends and the evaluation of the best fitted models were performed and c) the relationships between concentration and loads of constituents both with the discharge were also examined. Boxplots for summarising the distribution of a data set were used. The χ 2-test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used to select the theoretical distribution which best fitted the data. Simple regression was used to examine the concentration-discharge and the load-discharge relationships. According to the correlation coefficient (r) values the relation between concentrations and discharge is weak (r&lt; 0.592) while the relation between loads and discharge is very strong (r&gt;0.902). Trends were detected using the nonparametric Spearman's criterion upon the data for the variables: Q, ECw, DO, SO 4 2-, Na + +K + and NO 3-on which temporal trend analysis was performed.</td>

      <td>Surface and ground water resources are highly sensitive aquatic systems to contaminants due to their accessibility to multiple-point and non-point sources of pollutions. Determination of water quality variables using mathematical models instead of laboratory experiments can have venerable significance in term of the environmental prospective. In this research, application of a new developed hybrid response surface method (HRSM) which is a modified model of the existing response surface model (RSM) is proposed for the first time to predict biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in Euphrates River, Iraq. The model was constructed using various physical and chemical variables including water temperature (T), turbidity, power of hydrogen (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), alkalinity, calcium (Ca), chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulfate (SO 4 ), total dissolved solids (TDS), and total suspended solids (TSS) as input attributes. The monthly water quality sampling data for the period 2004–2013 was considered for structuring the input-output pattern required for the development of the models. An advance analysis was conducted to comprehend the correlation between the predictors and predictand. The prediction performances of HRSM were compared with that of support vector regression (SVR) model which is one of the most predominate applied machine learning approaches of the state-of-the-art for water quality prediction. The results indicated a very optimistic modeling accuracy of the proposed HRSM model to predict BOD and DO. Furthermore, the results showed a robust alternative mathematical model for determining water quality particularly in a data scarce region like Iraq.</td>

We introduce the application of canonical correlation analysis fusion as a method for water-based spectral analysis to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data. Water-quality variables and spectral reflectance were used to create predictive models via machine learning regression models, including multiple linear regression, partial least-squares regression, Gaussian process regression, support vector machine regression, and extreme learning machine regression. The models were then combined using decision-level fusion. Results indicate that canonical correlation analysis feature-level fusion and machine learning techniques are superior to traditional methods.</td>

Fresh and clean water is very limited in the world which is useful for agriculture, industry and for general uses. Discharge of poisonous chemicals, over-pushing of aquifers, long series spreading of pollutants and contamination of water bodies, like lake, ponds, sea with substances that motivate algal growth are few today's main causes of water quality degeneration. All these causes are monitoring and controlling using some chemical sensors and ubiquitous sensor networks, these sensors will transform the chemical information with range of concentration of specific components to total component analysis and sensor network will connects all other networks with smart sensors, those sensors will take information from physical environment and compute that collected information using some built-in predefined functions for the detection of exact input for processing data.To all these problems we are surveying the existing works which monitor the turbidity of water using Turbidity sensor. In our system the sensor is dipped in to the water where there is more pollution. The sensor is detached to the microcontroller, it's acts like the main function of system. The controller is connected to relay, which controls the gate of water valve. Once the purify data collect it is send to the cloud.

      <td>Economic development, population growth, industrialization, and urbanization dramatically increase urban water quality deterioration, and thereby endanger human life and health. However, there are not many efficient methods and techniques to monitor urban black and odorous water (BOW) pollution. Our research aims at identifying primary indicators of urban BOW through their spectral characteristics and differentiation. This research combined ground in-situ water quality data with ground hyperspectral data collected from main urban BOWs in Guangzhou, China, and integrated factorial data mining and machine learning techniques to investigate how to monitor urban BOW. Eight key water quality parameters at 52 sample sites were used to retrieve three latent dimensions of urban BOW quality by factorial data mining. The synchronically measured hyperspectral bands along with the band combinations were examined by the machine learning technique, Lasso regression, to identify the most correlated bands and band combinations, over which three multiple regression models were fitted against three latent water quality indicators to determine which spectral bands were highly sensitive to three dimensions of urban BOW pollution. The findings revealed that the many sensitive bands were concentrated in higher hyperspectral band ranges, which supported the unique contribution of hyperspectral data for monitoring water quality. In addition, this integrated data mining and machine learning approach overcame the limitations of conventional band selection, which focus on a limited number of band ratios, band differences, and reflectance bands in the lower range of infrared region. The outcome also indicated that the integration of dimensionality reduction with feature selection shows good potential for monitoring urban BOW. This new analysis framework can be used in urban BOW monitoring and provides scientific data for policymakers to monitor it.</td>

Kata kunci : Sistem Monitoring, Tingkat kekeruhan air, Sensor TSD-10 ABSTRACT A real time monitoring system for water turbidity levels using sensor TSD-10 has been designed. Water turbidity levels are measured through the utilization of voltage changes data in sensor triggered by turbidity alteration. The design of this monitoring system consists of hardware and software parts. The hardware comprises a sensor system, a dc motor driver using an IC L293D, a minimum system of microcontroller ATmega8 and USBtoSerial module.

Data collection is done by comparing the designed system with a standard turbidity measuring instrument named HACH 2100N. The data obtained through the measurement are analyzed using errors theories and interpolation. Based on the analysis, it is found that the output voltage of sensor decreases with the increase of turbidity with a sensitivity of 2 mV / NTU. The degree of sensor linearity correlation is determined in R 2 = 0.99. And, the percentage accuracy of average measurement is 93.49.</td>

      <td>The Water Quality Index (WQI) is the most common indicator to characterize surface water quality. This study introduces a new ensemble machine learning model called Extra Tree Regression (ETR) for predicting monthly WQI values at the Lam Tsuen River in Hong Kong. The ETR model performance is compared with that of the classic standalone models, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Decision Tree Regression (DTR). The monthly input water quality data including Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Electrical Conductivity (EC), Nitrate-Nitrogen (NO2 -N), Phosphate (PO3-4), potential for Hydrogen (pH), Temperature (T) and Turbidity (TUR) are used for building the prediction models. Various input data combinations are investigated and assessed in terms of prediction performance, using numerical indices and graphical comparisons. The analysis shows that the ETR model generally produces more accurate WQI predictions for both training and testing phases. Although including all the ten input variables achieves the highest prediction performance (R2test = 0.98, RMSEtest = 2.99), a combination of input parameters including only BOD, Turbidity and Phosphate concentration provides the second highest prediction accuracy (R2test = 0.97, RMSEtest = 3.74). The uncertainty analysis relative to model structure and input parameters highlights a higher sensitivity of the prediction results to the former. In general, the ETR model represents an improvement on previous approaches for WQI prediction, in terms of prediction performance and reduction in the number of input parameters.</td>

In this work, the Neural Network and Random Forest classifying algorithms are used to predict the number of contaminant injection locations. The prediction model is trained with data obtained from simulated contamination event scenarios with random injection starting time, duration, concentration value, and the number of injection locations which varies from 1 to 4. Classification is made to determine if single or multiple injection locations occurred, and to predict the exact number of injection locations. Data was obtained for two different benchmark networks, medium-sized network Net3 and largesized Richmond network. Additionally, an investigation of sensor layouts, demand uncertainty, and fuzzy sensors on model accuracy is conducted. The proposed approach shows excellent accuracy in predicting if single or multiple contaminant injections in a water supply network occurred and good accuracy for the exact number of injection locations.</td>

In this article, we analyze the challenges of using deep learning for remote-sensing data analysis, review recent advances, and provide resources we hope will make deep learning in remote sensing seem ridiculously simple.

Abstract Rivers are the most important water supply resource for the drinkable, agricultural and industrial demands. Therefore, estimation of water quality parameters in rivers is an essential and necessary task. This research applies the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), the Least Squares-Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) and the Gene Expression Programming (GEP) for estimation of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Electrical Conductivity (EC) and Total Hardness (TH) in the Sepidrood River and a 40 year period. The applied performance criteria are the correlation coefficient (R), the Nash-Sutcliffe model Efficiency coefficient (NSE), the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These methods have high ability for estimation of water quality parameters. The best method is LS-SVM method for estimation of TDS (RTrain=0.95 RTest=0.96). The best method is GEP method for estimation of EC (RTrain=0.94 RTest=0.95). The best method is ANFIS method for estimation of TH (RTrain=0.92 RTest=0.94). This research shows that intelligence methods can estimate unmeasured concentration of qualitative parameters by concentration of other qualitative parameters.</td>

      <td>Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations have been used as primary indicator of stream water quality. A problem of great social importance is determining how to best retain the quality of stream water and maintain DO concentrations using various pollution control activities. This paper presents the use of artificial neural network (ANN) technique to estimate the DO concentrations at the downstream of Mathura city, India, located at the bank of River Yamuna in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. In the analysis, the most commonly used feed forward error back propagation neural network technique has been applied. Monthly data sets on flow discharge, temperature, pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) at three locations, namely, Mathura (upstream), Mathura (central) and Mathura (downstream) have been used for the analysis. Feed forward error back propagation algorithm, the most commonly used ANN technique, was used to develop three types of ANN models using different combinations of input variables and input stations, namely: (a) All the data sets for stations Mathura (upstream), Mathura (central) and Mathura (downstream) except DO values at Mathura (downstream) (b) All data sets for the stations Mathura (upstream), and Mathura (central), and (c) All the data sets for the stations Mathura (upstream). The performance of the ANN technique has been evaluated using statistical tools (in terms of root mean square error and coefficient of correlation). The predicted values of DO showed prominent accuracy by producing high correlations (upto 0.9) between measured and predicted values.</td>

      <td>Water is an indispensable resource for human health and social well-being. However, the quality of this critical resource is being threatened by both natural and anthropogenic sources. Surface and groundwater resources in the Upper East Region of Ghana are poorly managed and monitored. The water resources in this part of Ghana are contaminated with coliforms, toxic trace metals, and agrochemicals. Most of the parameters for drinking water quality are seriously being violated in various parts of the region. The major sources of surface water and groundwater pollution in the region are the dissolution of minerals, the widespread application of agrochemicals on farms, biological contamination resulting from human and animal fecal matter due to open defecation and mining activities. These have resulted in diverse health-related problems in the region since the contaminated water sources are the only drinking water supplies for rural folks. Fluoride contamination of the groundwater resources is also a major problem in the region, especially in the Bongo District and the Bolgatanga Municipality, which has resulted in cases of dental fluorosis in these parts of the region. There exists no comprehensive review on the water quality in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Therefore, this review is aimed at discussing the quality of the water resources in the region from previously published works in various parts of the region. The review highlights the major pollutants, pollution sources, and the associated health problems. Recommendations have been offered based on the findings to serve as a framework for policy-making in regard to the water resources in the region.</td>

      <td>This paper reports on a low-cost turbidity sensor design for continuous on-line water quality monitoring applications. The measurement of turbidity by agricultural and environmental scientists is restricted by the current cost and functionality of available commercial instruments. Although there are a number of low-cost turbidity sensors exploited within domestic 'white-goods', such as dishwashers, the lack of sensitivity, and power-usage of these devices make them unsuitable for fresh-water quality monitoring purposes. The recent introduction of wireless protocols and hardware, associated with the 'Internet-of-Things' concept for machine-to-machine autonomous sensing and control, has enabled the large-scale networked intelligent water turbidity monitoring system that implements relatively low-cost sensors to be developed. The proposed sensor uses both transmitted light and orthogonal (90 degrees) scattered light detection principles, and is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower in cost compared to the existing commercial turbidity sensors. With an 850-nm infrared LED, and dual orthogonal photodetectors, the proposed design is capable of measuring turbidity within the range of 0-1000 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) with improved accuracy and robustness as compared with the existing low cost turbidity sensors. The combination of orthogonal and transmitted light detection unit provides both 0-200 NTU high resolution and accuracy sensing and 0-1000 NTU lower resolution and accuracy sensing capability. Results from calibration experiment are presented, which proved that the proposed sensor design produced comparable turbidity readings as that of a commercial turbidity sensor.</td>

Five samples of water with different turbidity were prepared and tested using different colours of LEDs. With respect to the actual values of the sample, the performances of the sensing system were evaluated. In terms of accuracy, White LED gives the best performance with less than 10% difference in most measurement and followed by UV LED. Meanwhile for precision, UV has the best performance as most of the measurement gives standard deviation of less than 1 and followed by White LED. Therefore the use of both colours are found to be suitable for water turbidity measurement ranging from 0 to 1000 NTU.

The selected optimal multivariable GAM could effectively explain the concentration variation of Chla occurring during each season, and the interpretation degree followed the order: summer &gt; autumn &gt; spring &gt; winter. The fitting results indicated that the concentration variation of Chla could reflect that of biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand in all seasons. In addition, the total phosphorus showed strong ability to explain the concentration change of Chla in spring and summer, as the growth of algae would be affected when the concentration of phosphorus shifted high or low. Nitrogen showed strong ability to explain the variations in Chla concentration in autumn. The conclusions of the optimal multivariable GAM could provide decision basis for the eutrophication control. In other words, the prevention of eutrophication outbreaks could be carried out via the targeted control of key water pollutants. According to these results, the concentration of Chla was higher in northern and western lake during summer and autumn, the management should focus on nutrient input of adjacent rivers.</td>

      <td>This paper demonstrates the application of data mining techniques to predict river water quality index. The usefulness of these techniques lies in the automated extraction of novel knowledge from the data to improve decision-making. The popular classification techniques, namely k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, Naive Bayes, artificial neural networks, rule-based and support vector machines were used to develop the predictive environment to classify water quality into understandable terms based on the Overall Index of Pollution. Experimentation was conducted on two types of data sets: synthetic and real. A repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure was followed to design the learning and testing frameworks of the predictive environment. Based on the validation results, it was found that the error rate in defining the true water quality class was 20 and 28%, 11 and 24%, 1 and 38% and 10 and 20% for the k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, artificial neural network and rule-based classifiers for synthetic and real data sets, respectively. The decision tree and support vector machines classifiers were found to be the best predictive models with 0% error rates during automated extraction of the water quality class. This study reveals that data mining techniques have the potential to quickly predict water quality class, provided data given are a true representation of the domain knowledge.</td>

In this context, the current study provides an overview of the quality of surface water and groundwater in rural and peri-urban areas of the Republic of South Africa (RSA) and Mozambique (MZ) in terms of concentrations of conventional pollutants, inorganic chemicals, microorganisms, and micropollutants. Their values were compared with the drinking water standards available for the two countries. Regarding surface water, it was found that microorganisms occur at high concentrations; nickel (RSA) and boron (MZ) are other critical parameters. Regarding groundwater, arsenic and lead (RSA) and boron, sodium, and chloride (MZ) are the main critical substances. With regard to micropollutants, their surface water concentrations are much higher than those in European rivers. The highest values were for ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, clozapine, and estriol. Suitable treatment is necessary to produce safe water depending on the main critical pollutants but, at the same time, action should be taken to improve wastewater treatment in rural areas to improve and safeguard surface water bodies and groundwater which are sources for drinking needs.</td>

Traditional monitoring techniques, although highly accurate, are vastly insufficient in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. Using a virtual constellation by harmonizing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data a high temporal frequency dataset can be created at a relatively fine spatial scale. In this study, we apply a novel deep learning method for the estimation of blue-green algae (BGA), chlorophyll-α (Chl), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductance (SC), and turbidity. The developed model is evaluated against previously studied machine learning methods and found to outperform multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and extreme learning machine regression (ELR) generating R2 of 0.91 for BGA, 0.88, 0.89, 0.93, 0.87, and 0.84 for Chl, DO, SC, and turbidity respectfully. This model is then applied to all available data ranging from 2013–2018 and time series for each variable were generated for four selected waterbodies. We then use the Empirical Data Analytics (EDA) anomaly detection method on the time series to identify abnormal data points. Upon further analysis, the EDA method successfully identifies abnormal events in water quality. Our results also demonstrate strong correlation between non-optically active variables such as SC with Chl and fDOM. The framework developed in this study represents an efficient and accurate empirical method for inland water quality monitoring at the regional scale.</td>

Multivariate data are sequences that have various attributes in every instance of the sequences. A few endeavours exist to address this issue; however, none of them has given full emphasis on continuous dataset. Another solution for this issue is to reduce the instances to a single attribute while losing significant information. Different arrangements address both the multivariate and the sequential part of the data yet give an un-versatile solution. The proposed algorithm is not only able to monitor continuous water quality, but it also produces a better classification model for other continuous datasets as well. Instead of decreasing the attributes of the dataset, we introduce three additional reference indicators which are dependent on the actual attributes. We compare the classification accuracy of our proposed algorithm with standard classification models. The proposed method gives better classification accuracy compared to existing methods.</td>

      <td>The development of water quality prediction models is an important step towards better water quality management of rivers. The traditional method for computing WQI is always associated with errors due to the protracted analysis of the water quality parameters in addition to the great effort and time involved in gathering and analyzing water samples. In addition, the cost of identifying the magnitude of some of the parameters through experimental testing is very high. The water quality of rivers in Malaysia is ranked into five classes based on water quality index (WQI). WQI is function of six water quality parameters: ammoniac nitrogen (NH3-N), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and suspended solids (SS). In this research, the decision tree machine learning technique is used to predict the WQI for the Klang River and its classification within a specific water quality class. Klang River is one of the most polluted rivers in Malaysia. Modeling experiments are designed to test the prediction and classification accuracy of the model based on various scenarios composed of different water quality parameters. Results show that the proposed prediction model has a promising potential to predict the class of the WQI. Moreover, the proposed model offers a more efficient process and cost-effective approach for the computation and prediction of WQI.</td>

General conditions of water quality parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, suspended solids, turbidity, salinity, oxidation reduction potential, alkalinity, total hardness), oxygenation parameters (dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, biological oxygen demand), nutrient parameters (ammonium-N, nitrite-N, nitrate-N, total phosphate, total phosphorus), trace elements, inorganic pollution parameters and suspended chlorophyll a content from biological parameters were examined. Analyzes were performed using standard methods. Multiple statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson correlation index (PCI) and clustering analysis (CA) were applied to the results. Water Quality Index (WQI) was used to determine the water quality of the stream and hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) was used for the evaluation of trace elements in terms of public health risk. The results showed that the Turnasuyu Stream has a very good water quality characteristic, and that the trace elements identified were not in dangerous limits for public health.

      <td>This paper considers newly emerging wireless technologies that can be explored for potential exploitation in the future wireless sensor network solutions for water quality monitoring applications. The reviewed technologies promise to address long-standing issues that confront existing wireless sensor network solutions devoted to the monitoring of water quality parameters. Such issues include energy efficiency and long-range water quality data communication. These issues can be attributed to the shortcomings of legacy communication networks commonly combined with wireless sensor network solutions, due to a discrepancy caused by traditionally powering the sensors nodes using batteries. In particular, some of the legacy communication networks suffer from short communication range, while others are limited by high power consumption. These shortcomings provide scope for the utilization of newly emerging solutions identified in this study to advance the field of a wireless sensor network for water quality monitoring. To achieve this, three key categories of communication networks have been recommended in this paper, including their architectural design and network deployment for water quality monitoring applications. Also, this paper provides future directions on the identified communication networks to enhance their performance for the next-generation of wireless sensor network solutions for water quality monitoring applications.</td>

The HSPF model was calibrated and validated using the observed water quality data from 2000 to 2016. For water quality simulation, we calculated the generated and discharge loads of the population, livestock, industry and land use following the guideline provided by the Ministry of Environment. The pollutant data were obtained from National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER). The monthly discharge load were estimated by applying the delivery rate. The calibration and validation results showed that the annual mean BOD had a difference of 0.22 mg/L and an error of ±13 %, T-N had a difference of 0.66 mg/L and an error of ±16 % and T-P had a difference of 0.027 mg/L and an error of ±13 %. In order to evaluate the nonpoint pollutants management effects, we applied livestock reduction scenarios because livestock consists of the largest portion of pollutants. As a result of the 20 % of livestock reduction, BOD, T-N and T-P decreased by 3 %, 1 % and 3 %, respectively. When 40 % of livestock reduction was applied, BOD, T-N and T-P decreased by 5 %, 3 % and 4 %, respectively. Based on the results of this study, effective pollutant management methods can be applied to improve the water quality and achieve the target water quality of Hapcheon dam watershed.</td>

      <td>This paper reports on a low-cost turbidity sensor design for continuous on-line water quality monitoring applications. The measurement of turbidity by agricultural and environmental scientists is restricted by the current cost and functionality of available commercial instruments. Although there are a number of low-cost turbidity sensors exploited within domestic 'white-goods', such as dishwashers, the lack of sensitivity, and power-usage of these devices make them unsuitable for fresh-water quality monitoring purposes. The recent introduction of wireless protocols and hardware, associated with the 'Internet-of-Things' concept for machine-to-machine autonomous sensing and control, has enabled the large-scale networked intelligent water turbidity monitoring system that implements relatively low-cost sensors to be developed. The proposed sensor uses both transmitted light and orthogonal (90 degrees) scattered light detection principles, and is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower in cost compared to the existing commercial turbidity sensors. With an 850-nm infrared LED, and dual orthogonal photodetectors, the proposed design is capable of measuring turbidity within the range of 0-1000 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) with improved accuracy and robustness as compared with the existing low cost turbidity sensors. The combination of orthogonal and transmitted light detection unit provides both 0-200 NTU high resolution and accuracy sensing and 0-1000 NTU lower resolution and accuracy sensing capability. Results from calibration experiment are presented, which proved that the proposed sensor design produced comparable turbidity readings as that of a commercial turbidity sensor.</td>

Passive samplers (Chemcatcher®) configured with hydrophilic–lipophilic balanced (HLB) sorbents were deployed in the Central London region of the tidal River Thames (UK) catchment in winter and summer campaigns in 2018 and 2019. Extracts were analysed by; (a) a rapid 5.5 min direct injection targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for 164 CECs and (b) a full-scan LC coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) method using data-independent acquisition over 15 min. From targeted analysis of grab water samples, a total of 33 pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, drug metabolites, personal care products and pesticides (including several EU Watch-List chemicals) were identified, and mean concentrations determined at 40 ± 37 ng L −1 . For targeted analysis of passive sampler extracts, 65 unique compounds were detected with differences observed between summer and winter campaigns. For suspect screening, 59 additional compounds were shortlisted based on mass spectral database matching, followed by machine learning-assisted retention time prediction. Many of these included additional pharmaceuticals and pesticides, but also new metabolites and industrial chemicals. The novelty in this approach lies in the convenience of using passive samplers together with machine learning-assisted chemical analysis methods for rapid, time-integrated catchment monitoring of CECs.</td>

      <td>Anthropogenic activities are seriously endangering the conservation of biodiversity worldwide, calling for urgent actions to mitigate their impact on ecosystems. We applied machine learning techniques to predict the response of freshwater ecosystems to multiple anthropogenic pressures, with the goal of informing the definition of water policy targets and management measures to recover and protect aquatic biodiversity. Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees algorithms were used for the modelling of the biological indices of macroinvertebrates and diatoms in the Tagus river basin (Spain). Among the anthropogenic stressors considered as explanatory variables, the categories of land cover in the upstream catchment area and the nutrient concentrations showed the highest impact on biological communities. The model was then used to predict the biological response to different nutrient concentrations in river water, with the goal of exploring the effect of different regulatory thresholds on the ecosystem status. Specifically, we considered the maximum nutrient concentrations set by the Spanish legislation, as well as by the legislation of other European Union Member States. According to our model, the current nutrient thresholds in Spain ensure values of biological indices consistent with the good ecological status in only about 60% of the total number of water bodies. By applying more restrictive nutrient concentrations, the number of water bodies with biological indices in good status could increase by almost 40%. Moreover, coupling more restrictive nutrient thresholds with measures that improve the riparian habitat yields up to 85% of water bodies with biological indices in good status, thus proving to be a key approach to restore the status of the ecosystem.</td>

      <td>Water quality is always one of the most important factors in human health. Artificial intelligence models are respected methods for modeling water quality. The evolutionary algorithm (EA)is a new technique for improving the performance of artificial intelligence models such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)and artificial neural networks (ANN). Attempts have been made to make the models more suitable and accurate with the replacement of other training methods that do not suffer from some shortcomings, including a tendency to being trapped in local optima or voluminous computations. This study investigated the applicability of ANFIS with particle swarm optimization (PSO)and ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACO R )in estimating water quality parameters at three stations along the Zayandehrood River, in Iran. The ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-ACO R methods were also compared with the classic ANFIS method, which uses least squares and gradient descent as training algorithms. The estimated water quality parameters in this study were electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), carbonate hardness (CH), and total hardness (TH). Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS software to determine the optimal inputs to the models. The analysis showed that ANFIS-PSO was the better model compared with ANFIS-ACO R . It is noteworthy that EA models can improve ANFIS' performance at all three stations for different water quality parameters.</td>

      <td>Knowledge of pore-water pressure (PWP) variation is fundamental for slope stability. A precise prediction of PWP is difficult due to complex physical mechanisms and in situ natural variability. To explore the applicability and advantages of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on PWP prediction, three variants of RNNs, i.e., standard RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are adopted and compared with a traditional static artificial neural network (ANN), i.e., multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Measurements of rainfall and PWP of representative piezometers from a fully instrumented natural slope in Hong Kong are used to establish the prediction models. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are used for model evaluations. The influence of input time series length on the model performance is investigated. The results reveal that MLP can provide acceptable performance but is not robust. The uncertainty bounds of RMSE of the MLP model range from 0.24 ​kPa to 1.12 ​kPa for the selected two piezometers. The standard RNN can perform better but the robustness is slightly affected when there are significant time lags between PWP changes and rainfall. The GRU and LSTM models can provide more precise and robust predictions than the standard RNN. The effects of the hidden layer structure and the dropout technique are investigated. The single-layer GRU is accurate enough for PWP prediction, whereas a double-layer GRU brings extra time cost with little accuracy improvement. The dropout technique is essential to overfitting prevention and improvement of accuracy.</td>

Water quality parameters studied include pH, temperature, acidity, total alkalinity, chloride content and total CO2. A Flame Atomic Absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine the concentrations of Ca, Mg, Cu, Cr, and Pb in the water samples. The total coliform was determined using the most probable number technique while a qualitative method was used to detect the presence of faecal coliform and E. coli in the water samples. All the physicochemical water quality parameters complied with regulatory standards. Similarly, most of the heavy metals also complied except for some sites. Faecal coliform and E. coli tested positive for all the samples except one of the tap water sample. Majority of the water samples (86%) were rated as excellent based on the physicochemical parameters. One sample each was rated as having poor and good water quality, respectively. All the samples tested positive for faecal coliform bacteria and E. coli except one (treated water). It is recommended that Microbial water quality parameters be included in all Water Quality Index (WQI) analyses in order to give the true status of the quality of a water resource.</td>

For example, Nepal faces several challenges in managing sporadic diarrheal outbreaks across the country, given its complex geographic terrain, and its susceptibility to extreme natural events like earthquakes, floods, and landslides. To assess the risks of diarrheal diseases caused by fecal contamination in several water sources in different geographical regions of Nepal, we conducted a two months cross-sectional study throughout 37 out of 75 districts in Nepal, including the ones affected by Nepal 2015 earthquake. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) was applied to estimate the human health risk based on Escherichia coli (E. coli) count for 2,822 water samples collected at source and households. Disease burden calculations suggested that Hilly and Terai (low-land) regions are at the highest risk with 0.27 and 0.16 DALYs per person per year (DALYpppy), respectively, whereas mountain region disease burden was 0.02 DALYpppy. The risk comparison among exposure pathways indicated that the water used in households, including drinking water and water for washing, posed higher risks than from source water, reservoir water or tap water, suggesting deteriorated sanitation conditions in households. These findings suggest that the combination of QMRA and spatial analysis can help to prioritize intervention activities after a major natural disaster.</td>

      <td>Recent advances in high-frequency water-quality sensors have enabled direct measurements of physical and chemical attributes in rivers and streams nearly continuously. Water-quality trends can be used to identify important watershed-scale changes driven by natural and anthropogenic influences. Statistical methods to estimate trends using high-frequency data are lacking. To address this gap, an evaluation of the generalized additive model (GAM) approach to test for trends in high-frequency data was conducted. Our proposed framework includes methods for handling serial correlation, trend estimation and slope-change detection, and trend interpretation at arithmetic scale for log-transformed variables. Water-temperature and turbidity data, representing two analytes with different temporal patterns, collected from the James River at Cartersville, Virginia, USA, were chosen for this analysis. Results indicated that the model, including flow, season, time covariates, and interaction between flow and season performed well for both analytes. The same model structure was applied to specific conductance data, collected from a small highly urbanized watershed, with satisfactory model performance. The water temperature GAM results indicated that the significant decreasing-then-increasing patterns after 2012 were mainly driven by air temperature changes. The turbidity trend was not significant over time. The specific conductance results showed a consistently upward trend over the last decade due to ever-increasing urbanization in the small watershed. This study suggests that the GAM method has great potential as a useful tool for trend analysis on high-frequency data, and for informing watershed managers of hydro-climatic and human influences on water quality by detecting crucial signal variation over time.</td>

      <td>Understanding the relationship between rivers water quality (RWQ) and landscape metrics (LMs) is valuable for developing sustainable watershed management practices and pollution/environmental risk mitigation. To do so, the current study aimed to explore the relationship between RWQ and LMs by assessing 74 sub-basins within 2 million ha in Northern Iran. Principal component analyses were used to identify principal water quality parameters. Considering the effect of composition and configuration of the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) on pollution loads, statistical models revealed that by increasing the mean of the Fractal Dimension Index of agricultural lands, the nitrate loads will increase. The results of this study can be especially used in the environmental impact/risk assessment of new industrial and residential applications. Also, the findings of the current study could provide a perfect source for calculations and choosing the best policy making decisions.</td>

Recently, artificial intelligence methods have been broadly applied to simulate hydrological processes. This study evaluates the potential of applying the neuro-fuzzy system and neural network to simulate total dissolved solid and electrical conductivity levels, by employing the values of other existing water quality parameters. Consideration of these results will be important for implementing and adopting a water quality prediction model which is able to provide a useful tool for the management of water resources. In this study, water quality data were analyzed from five sampling stations over six years from 2008 to 2013, in the Langat Basin, Malaysia. An assessment of the model's performance was carried out through the correlation coefficient and mean squared error obtained from the model computation and measurement values of the dependent variables. Consequently, a close agreement between these values and their respective measured values in the quality of the groundwater were found. Accordingly, artificial intelligence approaches and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system models in particular are capable of interpreting the behavior of water quality parameters.

      <td>Continuous high frequency water quality monitoring is becoming a critical task to support water management. Despite the advancements in sensor technologies, certain variables cannot be easily and/or economically monitored in-situ and in real time. In these cases, surrogate measures can be used to make estimations by means of data-driven models. In this work, variables that are commonly measured in-situ are used as surrogates to estimate the concentrations of nutrients in a rural catchment and in an urban one, making use of machine learning models, specifically Random Forests. The results are compared with those of linear modelling using the same number of surrogates, obtaining a reduction in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of up to 60.1%. The profit from including up to seven surrogate sensors was computed, concluding that adding more than 4 and 5 sensors in each of the catchments respectively was not worthy in terms of error improvement.</td>

      <td>The sensors grouped to gather to form the network of their own, in the wireless medium and communicating to the each other over radio, faces issues that leads to failure in continuous communication, causing miss communication as it is powered by batteries with limited energy availability So it becomes essential to device a perfect routing scheme that is energy efficient. Though the clustering approach was found to be highly efficient to manage the transmission from source to the target. The elected head in each cluster has to take the entire load on it as it has to gather all the data and transmit it to the base station. So it was necessary to balance the load in the network formed using the sensor and communicating in wireless medium. The GWO (Grey Wolf Optimization)-PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) based clustering is followed in the paper to have a perfect clustering with balanced load as well as energy efficient optimization.

      <td>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify future changes in weather variables (precipitation and temperature) due to climate change using different general circulation models (GCMs) for different emission scenarios, so as to assess the impact of climate change on river discharge and sediment yield in the Dehbar river basin in Iran. Materials and methods: The magnitude and uncertainty of the impact of climate change on river discharge and sediment yield in the Dehbar river basin in Iran is quantified using a calibrated and validated SWAT model with future weather inputs generated using the LARS-WG6 program to downscale the output of five large-scale GCMs for three possible emission scenarios (RCP26, RCP45, and RCP85) and the period 2021–2040. Results and discussion: Annual maximum and minimum temperatures are projected to increase by 22–28% and 65–84%, respectively, with a 1-month shift in temperature peak. The future rainfall amounts show both increasing (fall and winter) and decreasing (spring and summer) trends. Future temperature and rainfall patterns are predicted to cause the largest flows to occur a month earlier (February instead of March), an increase in discharge in the “wet” months of fall and winter (up to 137%) and a decrease in the “dry” months of spring and summer (down to − 100%). Sediment yield, which is caused by runoff (also controlling river discharge), has a similar projected trend, with a general decrease in spring and summer (down to − 95%) and an increase in fall and winter (up to 340%). The coefficient of variation of the future monthly, seasonal and annual river discharges and sediment yields are relatively low, revealing a general agreement in projections among the different GCM and RCP scenarios considered. Conclusions: This study highlights the significant negative impact of climate change on the Dehbar river basin, with amplification of river flows and sediment concentrations in the wet season and increased water scarcity in the dry season. Both effects may adversely impact the region’s livelihood (cultivation, fish farming) and land resources.</td>

      <td>Real-time water quality (WQ) sensors in water distribution networks (WDN) have the potential to enable network-wide observability of water quality indicators, contamination event detection, and closed-loop feedback control of WQ dynamics. To that end, prior research has investigated a wide range of methods that guide the geographic placement of WQ sensors. These methods assign a metric for fixed sensor placement (SP) followed by \textit\{metric-optimization\} to obtain optimal SP. These metrics include minimizing intrusion detection time, minimizing the expected population and amount of contaminated water affected by an intrusion event. In contrast to the literature, the objective of this paper is to provide a computational method that considers the overlooked metric of state estimation and network-wide observability of the WQ dynamics. This metric finds the optimal WQ sensor placement that minimizes the state estimation error via the Kalman filter for noisy WQ dynamics -- a metric that quantifies WDN observability. To that end, the state-space dynamics of WQ states for an entire WDN are given and the observability-driven sensor placement algorithm is presented. The algorithm takes into account the time-varying nature of WQ dynamics due to changes in the hydraulic profile -- a collection of hydraulic states including heads (pressures) at nodes and flow rates in links which are caused by a demand profile over a certain period of time. Thorough case studies are given, highlighting key findings, observations, and recommendations for WDN operators. Github codes are included for reproducibility.</td>

      <td>River water quality is one of the main challenges that societies face during the 21st century. Accurate and reliable real-time prediction of water quality is an effective adaptation measure to counteract water quality issues such as accidental spill and harmful algae blooms. To improve accuracy and skill of water quality forecasts along the Yeongsan River in South Korea three different ensemble data assimilation (DA) methods have been investigated: the traditional Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and two related algorithms (Dud-EnKF and EnKF-GS) that offer either possibilities to improve initial conditions for non-linear models or reduce computation time (important for real-time forecasting) by using a (smaller) time-lagged ensemble to estimate the Kalman gain. Twin experiments, assimilating synthetic observations of three algae species and phosphate concentrations, with relatively small ensemble sizes showed that all three DA methods improved forecast accuracy and skill with only subtle difference between the methods. They all improved the model accuracy at downstream locations with very similar performances but due to spurious correlation, the accuracy at upstream locations was somewhat deteriorated. The experiments also showed no clear trend of improvement by increasing the ensemble size from 8 to 64. The real world experiments, assimilating real observations of three algae species and phosphate concentrations, showed that less improvement was achieved compared to the twin experiments. Further improvement of the model accuracy may be achieved with different state variable definitions, use of different perturbation and error modelling settings and/or better calibration of the deterministic water quality model.</td>

      <td>Total phosphorus (TP) is an important factor of eutrophication. The accurate monitoring of TP concentration is conducive to the management of water environments. To improve the accuracy of TP remote sensing inversion, this paper improved and studied the following three aspects. First, a new optical classification method was constructed to classify water into two different types. Compared with other classification methods, the proposed method can be more effective for improving the accuracy of TP inversion. Second, data regression analysis and fitting (DRF), back propagation neural network (BP) and random forest (RF) were used to build TP inversion models based on the different water type. The validation results indicated that the DRF performed best, with the highest precision for all water types, and was suitable for TP inversion. Finally, the performance of the classification and inversion algorithms on Sentinel-3 data was evaluated and one image was acquired for mapping the TP concentration in Taihu Lake. All in all, this study improves the accuracy of TP inversion by combining the new classification algorithm with DRF. This is significant for the development of class-based water quality parameter inversion algorithms for water color remote sensing, and this approach can be applied in the effective management and control of the eutrophication of lake environments.</td>

The effects of un-clean water are far-reaching, impacting every aspect of life. Therefore, management of water resources is very crucial in order to optimize the quality of water. The effects of water contamination can be tackled efficiently if data is analyzed and water quality is predicted beforehand. This issue has been addressed in many previous researches, however, more work needs to be done in terms of effectiveness, reliability, accuracy as well as usability of the current water quality management methodologies. The goal of this study is to develop a water quality prediction model with the help of water quality factors using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and time-series analysis. This research uses the water quality historical data of the year of 2014, with 6-minutes time interval. Data is obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) online resource called National Water Information System (NWIS). For this paper, the data includes the measurements of 4 parameters which affect and influence water quality. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of model, the performance evaluation measures used are Mean-Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) and Regression Analysis. Previous works about Water Quality prediction have also been analyzed and future improvements have been proposed in this paper.</td>

      <td>The tradeoff between engineering costs and water treatment of the artificial lake system has a significant effect on engineering decision-making. However, decision-makers have little access to scientific tools to balance engineering costs against corresponding water treatment. In this study, a framework integrating numerical modeling, surrogate models and multi-objective optimization is proposed. This framework was applied to a practical case in Chengdu, China. A water quality model (MIKE21) was developed, providing training datasets for surrogate modeling. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were utilized for training surrogate models. Both surrogate models were validated with the coefficient of determinations (R2) greater than 0.98. SVM performed more stably with limited training data sizes while ANN demonstrated higher accuracies with more training samples. The multi-objective optimization model was developed using the genetic algorithm, with targets of reducing both engineering costs and target aquatic pollutant concentrations. An optimal target concentration after treatment was identified, characterized by the ammonia concentration (1.3 mg/L) in the artificial lake. Furthermore, scenarios with varying water quality in the upstream river were evaluated. Given the assumption of deteriorated upstream water quality in the future, the optimal proportion of pre-treatment in the total costs is increasing.</td>

In this study, image-based methods were used to measure surface flow velocities during a wadi flash flood in 2018 to test the usefulness of large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) and space-time image velocimetry (STIV) techniques for the estimation of wadi discharge. The results, which indicated the positive performance of the image-based methods, strengthened our hypothesis that the application of LSPIV and STIV techniques is appropriate for the analysis of wadi flash flood velocities. STIV is suitable for unidirectional flow velocity and LSPIV is reliable and stable for two-dimensional measurement along the wadi channel, the direction of flow pattern which varies with time.</td>

      <td>Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is used to determine the amount of dissolved oxygen used by microbial oxidation of organic content. BOD is a parameter describing the quality of water, especially its extent of pollution. Water from wastewater treatment plants have high BOD values and as such require to be treated. For this purpose, BOD is used as an indicator in determining the quality of water being discharged. The standard method for measuring BOD is a 5-day process. Dilution of sample, constant pH and nutrient content besides temperature of 20°C and dark area are required for correct results. High levels of nitrogen compounds yield false BOD results. Winkler titration, which is also used to measure DO (as part of BOD measurement), is a chemical-intensive process. Hence an automatic prediction model for BOD is required for accurate, cost-effective and time-saving measurement. Based on data available for BOD measurements, the present study focuses on devising a prediction model for BOD using ensemble techniques in data mining. A correlation coefficient of 0.9541 and a root mean-squared error of 0.4679 were obtained for the proposed BOD prediction model on river water quality data. Comparative analysis of the proposed model with existing models built for the same data set was also performed.</td>

      <td>This study involved the evaluation of time-series relationships between chlorophyll-a (chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH in three facultative wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) operated in series at a wastewater treatment plant in eastern Ontario, Canada. Since 2003, the WSP system has experienced high pH levels and excessive algae growth during the summer months. During the summer of 2013, chl-a, DO, pH, temperature, and daily solar radiation were monitored on an hourly basis for each WSP over a one-week period, with an additional two weeks conducted in WSP#2 to provide a more robust data set. Time-series analyses, consisting of cross-correlation evaluations, were performed on the dataset to investigate the time-dependent dynamics between chl-a, DO, and pH. Strong statistical dependence between chl-a, DO, and pH was identified during periods of high photosynthetic activity and algae growth. WSP#2 had the highest algae growth and the statistical relationships between chl-a and DO and chl-a and pH were the strongest, with maximum cross-correlation coefficients of 0.54 and 0.56 observed at lags of 20 and 16 hours for DO and pH, respectively. Strong diurnal patterns for DO and pH were observed in WSP#1 and WSP#4, and in WSP#2 during periods of reduced algae growth. During periods of excessive algae growth in WSP#2, no clear DO and pH diurnal patterns were noted. In general, across all WSPs, daily DO concentration peaks led those of chl-a by an average of 43 minutes, which subsequently led those of pH by an average of 2 hours and 15 minutes.</td>

These physiochemical parameters are used to detect water contaminants. The sensors, which are designed from first principles and implemented with signal conditioning circuits, are connected to a microcontroller-based measuring node, which processes and analyzes the data. In this design, ZigBee receiver and transmitter modules are used for communication between the measuring and notification nodes. The notification node presents the reading of the sensors and outputs an audio alert when water quality parameters reach unsafe levels. Various qualification tests are run to validate each aspect of the monitoring system. The sensors are shown to work within their intended accuracy ranges. The measurement node is able to transmit data by ZigBee to the notification node for audio and visual display. The results demonstrate that the system is capable of reading physiochemical parameters, and can successfully process, transmit, and display the readings.</td>

In addition, it also aims to specify the suitable WQI computation method in Iraq. Al-Shula City, Baghdad, Iraq was considered as the case study. The results of estimating the WQI in the Al-Shula City using WA and (CCME) methods for each month fluctuated between 0.103 to 8645 and 8.53 to 58.56, respectively. Hence the WQ fluctuated between excellent to unsuitable for drinking (excellent to poor). However, the range of the computed accumulated WA and CCME WQI was between 8 to 3886 and 9 to 59. Consequently, for the two methods, the class of WQ is fluctuated between excellent to unsuitable and excellent to poor. In addition, the calculated CCME WQIs were always lower than the computed WA WQIs. Therefore, the CCME method is permissive or somewhat lenient in contrast to the WA method. Consequently, the WA WQI is more sensitive to presence of toxic contaminants than the CCME WQI. Therefore, the WA WQI is more suitable to use in Iraq because of the high fluctuation in the level and types of pollution sources.</td>

Conceptually evidenced, sediment load transport is highly stochastic, spatial distributed and redundant pattern due to the incorporation of various hydrological and morphological variables such as river flow discharge and sediment physical properties. The motivation of this study is to explore the feasibility of newly intelligent model called Radial basis M5 model tree (RM5Tree) for suspended sediment load (St) prediction for daily scale information at Trenton hydrological station, Delaware River. Numerous input combination attributes are formulated based on the preceding information of sediment and river flow discharge. The prediction accuracy “based statistical and graphical visualizations” of the proposed model validated against numerous well-established predictive models including response surface method (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN) and classical M5Tree based models. The investigated input combinations behaved differently from one case to another. The optimum input combination attributes are included two months lead times of sediment and discharge information to predict one step ahead St. The attained results of the proposed RM5Tree model exhibited a remarkable prediction accuracy with minimal values of root mean square error (RMSE≈2091 ton/day) and coefficient of determination (R2≈0.86). This presenting a percentage of enhancement in the prediction accuracies by (51.6, 53.1 and 26.3) over (RSM, ANN and M5Tree) optimal models over the testing phase.</td>

Currently, the ecological status of water systems is still judged based on single point measurements, without taking into account the spatial and temporal variability of water quality and ecology. There is a need for better and more dynamic monitoring methods and technologies. Aquatic drones are becoming accessible and intuitive tools that may have an important role in water management. This paper describes the outcomes, field experiences and feedback gathered from the use of underwater drones equipped with sensors and video cameras in various pilot applications in The Netherlands, in collaboration with local water managers. It was observed that, in many situations, the use of underwater drones allows one to obtain information that would be costly and even impossible to obtain with other methods and provides a unique combination of three-dimensional data and underwater footage/images. From data collected with drones, it was possible to map different areas with contrasting vegetation, to establish connections between fauna/flora species and local water quality conditions, or to observe variations of water quality parameters with water depth. This study identifies opportunities for the application of this technology, discusses their limitations and obstacles, and proposes recommendation guidelines for new technical designs.</td>

Specimens taken from reference sites demonstrated a heart rate recovery time of &lt; 60 min after testing with changed salinity load, while those collected from sites characterized by high anthropogenic pressure demonstrated a prolonged recovery time of up to 110–360 min. These results make possible a discrimination of the study sites based on the assessment of physiological adaptive capacities of inhabiting species. In addition, the approach of measuring heart rate characteristics in M. balthica transplanted in cages to specific target areas was successfully used to evaluate the decline in the adaptive potential of mollusks exposed at polluted sites. Application of the novel system is a useful tool for the biomonitoring of freshwater and brackish water areas. Development of methodological basis for the testing of adaptive capacities (health) of key aquatic organisms provides new knowledge of biological effects of anthropogenic chemical stress in aquatic organisms.</td>

Seasonality was considered by comparing monthly data pairs. In addition, a diagonal pair comparison plot was proposed as a visual comparison method. This plot is a graphic data display, where monthly paired water quality is represented by X-Y coordinates.

      <td>In this paper, an attempt has been made to develop a statistical model based on Internet of Things (IoT) for water quality analysis of river Krishna using different water quality parameters such as pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids and conductivity. These parameters are very important to assess the water quality of the river. The water quality data were collected from six stations of river Krishna in the state of Karnataka. River Krishna is the fourth largest river in India with approximately 1400 km of length and flows from its origin toward Bay of Bengal. In our study, we have considered only stretch of river Krishna flowing in state of Karnataka, i.e., length of about 483 km. In recent years, the mineral-rich river basin is subjected to rapid industrialization, thus polluting the river basin. The river water is bound to get polluted from various pollutants such as the urban waste water, agricultural waste and industrial waste, thus making it unusable for anthropogenic activities. The traditional manual technique that is under use is a very slow process. It requires staff to collect the water samples from the site and take them to the laboratory and then perform the analysis on various water parameters which is costly and time-consuming process. The timely information about water quality is thus unavailable to the people in the river basin area. This creates a perfect opportunity for swift real-time water quality check through analysis of water samples collected from the river Krishna. IoT is one of the ways with which real-time monitoring of water quality of river Krishna can be done in quick time. In this paper, we have emphasized on IoT-based water quality monitoring by applying the statistical analysis for the data collected from the river Krishna. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-way ANOVA were applied for the data collected, and found that one-way ANOVA was more effective in carrying out water quality analysis. The hypotheses that are drawn using ANOVA were used for water quality analysis. Further, these analyses can be used to train the IoT system so that it can take the decision whenever there is abnormal change in the reading of any of the water quality parameters.</td>

      <td>This study investigated the physicochemical water chemistry monitoring in River Sutlej impact-ed by the tanning industry. We performed this study for nine months at four study sites and targeted the presence of selected metals and applied multivariate analytical techniques. The results divulged that the upstream region displayed higher mean values of pH (7.77) and dissolved oxygen (5.86 mg/L). However , severe water quality degradation observed in the downstream region. The mean electrical conductivity (3.27 mS/cm), total dissolved solids (1442.7 mg/L), salinity (1.32 mg/L), total alkalinity (285.5 mg/L), hardness (195 mg/L), chlorides (912.5 mg/L) and nitrates (4.73 mg/L) recorded in downstream indicated severe water quality degradation. Similarly, the selected metals chromium (1.21 mg/L) and lead (0.83 mg/L) recorded significantly higher downstream. However, cadmium remained insignificant in both riverine zones. Most of the targeted parameters and metals studied in the river and Rohi Nullah Jamman (RNJ) either surpassed or deviated from the national surface water quality standards indicating thereby severe impact of the tanning industry. The metals concentrations revealed the array of chromium &gt; lead &gt; cadmium. The correlation analyses on water chemistry and metals indicated strong (r &gt;0.70) to moderately strong (r &lt;0.70-&gt;0.50) relationship. The hierarchical cluster analysis displayed metals and significant parameters originating from similar sources that could be the tanning and sewage effluents. The principal component analysis explained the 96.39% of the total variance and approximated with the results obtained by cluster analysis. The Mann Kendall Trend test indicated an increasing tendency in metals and critical water quality parameters that calls for prudent actions on water quality management. In conclusion, this study alluded to the continuously deteriorating water quality of River Sutlej that poses potential ecological and human health risks. The water quality deterioration is believed to be the result of tanning activities that could severely impact the river biodiversity.</td>

      <td>River water quality assessment is one of the most important tasks to enhance water resources management plans. A water quality index (WQI) considers several water quality variables simultaneously. Traditionally WQI calculations consume time and are often fraught with errors during derivations of sub-indices. In this study, 4 standalone (random forest (RF), M5P, random tree (RT), and reduced error pruning tree (REPT)) and 12 hybrid data-mining algorithms (combinations of standalones with bagging (BA), CV parameter selection (CVPS) and randomizable filtered classification (RFC)) were used to create Iran WQI (IRWQIsc) predictions. Six years (2012 to 2018) of monthly data from two water quality monitoring stations within the Talar catchment were compiled. Using Pearson correlation coefficients, 10 different input combinations were constructed. The data were divided into two groups (ratio 70:30) for model building (training dataset) and model validation (testing dataset) using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. The models were evaluated using several statistical and visual evaluation metrics. Result show that fecal coliform (FC) and total solids (TS) had the greatest and least effect on the prediction of IRWQIsc. The best input combinations varied among the algorithms; generally variables with very low correlations displayed weaker performance. Hybrid algorithms improved the prediction power of several of the standalone models, but not all. Hybrid BA-RT outperformed the other models (R2 = 0.941, RMSE = 2.71, MAE = 1.87, NSE = 0.941, PBIAS = 0.500). PBIAS indicated that all algorithms, with the exceptions of RT, BA-RT and CVPS-REPT, overestimated WQI values.</td>

      <td>An event-driven, urban, drinking water quality early warning and control system (DEWS) is proposed to cope with China's urgent need for protecting its urban drinking water. The DEWS has a web service structure and provides users with water quality monitoring functions, water quality early warning functions, and water quality accident decision-making functions. The DEWS functionality is guided by the principles of control theory and risk assessment as applied to the feedback control of urban water supply systems. The DEWS has been deployed in several large Chinese cities and found to perform well insofar as water quality early warning and emergency decision-making is concerned. This paper describes a DEWS for urban water quality protection that has been developed in China. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</td>

      <td>ABSTRACTAccurate detection of water quality changes is a crucial task of water companies. Water supply companies must provide safe drinking water. Nowadays in different areas, we find sensible sensors which monitor data during the time. Normally the data registered by the sensors contain a meaning, such as there can be any event. Sometimes the data are ill-understood and stating if there is an event which is difficult. This work represents the description of several approaches to identifying changes or anomalies occurring on water quality time series data. This work also discusses and proposes a solution to some challenges when dealing with time series data. The following models are applied to water quality data: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The performance evaluation is conducted using F-score metric. A simulation study is condu...</td>

      <td>Water resources planning, development, and management need reliable forecasts of river flows. In past few decades, an important dimension has been introduced in the prediction of the hydrologic phenomenon through artificial intelligence-based modeling. In this paper, the performance of three artificial neural network (ANN) and four support vector regression (SVR) models was investigated to predict streamflows in the Upper Indus River. Results from ANN models using three different optimization techniques, namely Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon, Conjugate Gradient, and Back Propagation algorithms, were compared with one another. A further comparison was made between these ANNs and four types of SVR models which were based on linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid kernels. Past 30 years’ monthly data for precipitation, temperature, and streamflow obtained from Pakistan Surface Water Hydrology Department Lahore were used for this purpose. Three types of input combinations with respect to the main input variables (temperature, precipitation, and stream flow) and several types of input combinations with respect to time lag were tested. The best input for ANN and SVR models was identified using correlation coefficient analysis and genetic algorithm. The performance of the ANN and SVR models was evaluated by mean bias error, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient. The efficiency of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon-ANN model was found to be much better than that of other models, while the SVR model based on radial basis function kernel predicted stream flows with comparatively higher accuracy than the other kernels. Finally, long-term predictions of streamflow have been made by the best ANN model. It was found that stream flow of Upper Indus River has a decreasing trend.</td>

      <td>Intelligent waste classification system using deep learning convolutional neural network</td>

      <td>The accumulation of solid waste in the urban area is becoming a great concern, and it would result in environmental pollution and may be hazardous to human health if it is not properly managed. It is important to have an advanced/intelligent waste management system to manage a variety of waste materials. One of the most important steps of waste management is the separation of the waste into the different components and this process is normally done manually by hand-picking. To simplify the process, we propose an intelligent waste material classification system, which is developed by using the 50-layer residual net pre-train (ResNet-50) Convolutional Neural Network model which is a machine learning tool and serves as the extractor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is used to classify the waste into different groups/types such as glass, metal, paper, and plastic etc. The proposed system is tested on the trash image dataset which was developed by Gary Thung and Mindy Yang, and is able to achieve an accuracy of 87% on the dataset. The separation process of the waste will be faster and intelligent using the proposed waste material classification system without or reducing human involvement.</td>
